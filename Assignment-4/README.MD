CRUD operations from the VATSIM Data

Mongoose provides information on performing Create, Read, Update, and Delete functions for saving JSON documents into a MongoDB application.  Using your MongDB Atlas account, and the model's you have recently created for the previous VATSIM-focused assignment.

Move the project forward by providing ExpressJS code to take the translated JSON/JavaScript objects and write them to the database at MongoDB Atlas.

The Mongoose docs should be sufficient for this: https://mongoosejs.com/docs/index.html
