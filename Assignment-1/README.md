# Starting Out with Node, Express, and Pug

It is imperative that you work through these chapters methodically.  Among the things you'll learn are:

    Installing Node and NPM
    Installing Express
    Utilizing Pug
    Transforming the basic Express project template into an MVC template
    Creating Pug template views
    Creating controllers to work with routing and logic
    What does MVC mean?
    Using Git (and for us, Github)
    Deploying to Heroku
    Tasks

Near the end of chapter four, Simon shows us two important things:

    how to work with mixins and includes to develop reusable aspects of your Pug templates
    how to work with data within your Pug template
    What we need to do is modify Simon's code to create a different list of items (rather than locations for wifi).  Here is what you need to do:

Obtain Simon's chapter 4 code and git pull or download it.

    Modify the code to include an additional list page of three (3) select pizza restaurants in Amarillo and/or Canyon (this means another tab in the navigation for the pizza places)

    Modify the code to develop attributes for each restaurant (they will be different than what Simon uses for locations).

    Modify and/or Copy and Modify the layout.pug, location-info.pug, and locations-list.pug files to accomplish these tasks.

    Since Simon is using a 3rd-party Bootstrap theme, you should do so as well.  The results may not be what you expect, but I want you to experiment.

    Create an additional mixin that will also shade the background of each item in the locations-list for your pizza restaurants different colors depending on their rating.
